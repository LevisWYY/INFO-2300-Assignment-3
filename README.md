# INFO-2300-Assignment-3
This Repo is all for Assignment 3

#Yuyuan Wang Created INFO 2300 Assignmen 3
I will be using a old old project from my PROG 1245 HTML Class


# About the Project
I used one of my old old Project form my INFO 1245 Class. The Project is about a new Sports Club. This Project has 4 total pages. But the Last 2 pages (Which are Ping-Pong and Golf, when you click it, it says under Construction. Don't worry, that is the instruction that what we need to do on year 1 when we do the assignment).

# How to Navigate the Repo
I will put a link on both the repo and the Project itself on the Assignment 3 Handin.html. You can easily click on both link to access the project. The repo is public (FOR SURE) and the Project is also public.

# For Developer Side

This part, to be honest. I am not quite certain. But I am pretty sure the project will follow normal html format. Including coding; Commenting and making sure everything is working properly. For unit testing part. I will try to test multiple times with the different html that I put. Making sure that everything worked well. For Build the project part I will ensure that every element is clear enough for user to see and use. Includes Images; Stylesheet (CSS) and some other features that is in this project. Finally I will use the GitHub Page create a link for this project and put it on Assignment 3 Handin.html.

# Future Enhancements
We will use the Version Control for the code and to test before it goes live making sure everything worked properly.

# How to Run the Project
This project will have a Github Page link. After you click on the link. Click on each sports will go to the sport page. E.g: When you click on Football. It will go to Football. When you click on Basketball, it will go to Basketball. And when you click on the image on the sport. It will take you to the description part. Besides Ping-Pong and Golf which is under Construction in this case.
