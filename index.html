                        <p>Football, also called association football or soccer, game in which 
						two teams of 11 players, using any part of their bodies except their 
						hands and arms, try to maneuver the ball into the opposing team’s 
						goal. Only the goalkeeper is permitted to handle the ball and may 
						do so only within the penalty area surrounding the goal. The team 
						that scores more goals wins.</p>

						court, usually indoors. Each team tries to score by tossing the ball through the 
						opponent’s goal, an elevated horizontal hoop and net called a basket.</p>
                        <p>The only major sport strictly of U.S. origin, basketball was invented 
						by James Naismith (1861–1939) on or about December 1, 1891, at the 
						International Young Men’s Christian Association (YMCA) Training 
						School (now Springfield College), Springfield, Massachusetts, 
						where Naismith was an instructor in physical education. </p>

                        <p>Table tennis, also known as ping-pong and whiff-whaff, is a sport in which two or 
						four players hit a lightweight ball, also known as the ping-pong ball, back and forth 
						across a table using small rackets. The game takes place on a hard table divided by a 
						net. Except for the initial serve, the rules are generally as follows: players must 
						allow a ball played toward them to bounce one time on their side of the table, 
						and must return it so that it bounces on the opposite side at least once. A 
						point is scored when a player fails to return the ball within the rules. 
						Play is fast and demands quick reactions. Spinning the ball alters its 
						trajectory and limits an opponent's options, giving the hitter a great 
						advantage. </p>

                        <p>Golf is a club-and-ball sport in which players use various clubs to hit balls into 
						a series of holes on a course in as few strokes as possible.</p>
                        <p>Golf, unlike most ball games, cannot and does not utilize a standardized 
						playing area, and coping with the varied terrains encountered on different 
						courses is a key part of the game. The game at the usual level is played 
						on a course with an arranged progression of 18 holes, though recreational 
						courses can be smaller, often having nine holes. Each hole on the course 
						must contain a teeing ground to start from, and a putting green 
						containing the actual hole or cup 4 1⁄4 inches (11 cm) in diameter. 
						There are other standard forms of terrain in between, such as the 
						fairway, rough (long grass), bunkers (or "sand traps"), and various 
						hazards (water, rocks) but each hole on a course is unique in its 
						specific layout and arrangement.</p>
